# Fitness-App

Utilizing JS, Leaflet, HTML, CSS, etc

Status - Near Done

# ABOUT
As gyms shut down due to COVID-19, many were affected including myself. So I utilized JS, HTML/CSS to make a change. I utilized external libraries & API's, Async/await, Promises, OOP, functions, error handling, decision control, loops, JSON, and many integrated methods to come with a solution to the aforementioned.


# How does the app work?

- A map is displayed, once the user clicks at any area of the map, a forum will be presented as well as a marker being placed

- Once the forum is filled, the workout activity will be logged and saved to local storage

- Such a log can later on be edited or deleted

- Move to marker when log is clicked
